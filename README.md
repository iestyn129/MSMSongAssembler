# MSM Song Assembler
A quick and dirty program for assembling songs from My Singing Monsters using their midi and track data.
## Usage
Install the requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run
```sh
python main.py {midi_folder} {bin_folder} {audio_folder} {output_folder}
```
With the correct paths the folders containing the midis, bin, and audio the game uses, as well as the folder you wish to output to. Be warned the output folder will be deleted before running.
